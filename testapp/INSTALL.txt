Testapp is a web application used to test Jelix. It contains some pages where you can try
some features, and some unit tests.

If you want to launch testapp and its tests from a Vagrant machine (virtual machine),
install Testapp from the git repository. Else if you want to install all dependancies
by hand, see section about the installation from the archive.


Installation of testapp from the git repository
===============================================

- do

    git clone https://github.com/jelix/jelix.git

Installation of testapp from the archive
========================================

- Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.com)
- download and install a "developer" edition of Jelix
- move the testapp directory at the same level of the lib/ directory of jelix.
- in the testapp/ directory, launch composer to install dependancies (phpunit..)

  composer install

    - section jdb:testapp and jdb:testapp_mysqli for mysql,
    - section jdb:testapppdo if you have pdo extension

    don't touch other  "jdb" sections !

  instead of modifying testapp/var/config/mainconfig.ini.php
- create the "testapp/"  directories in the temp directory of Jelix
- put write access for apache on temp/testapp/, testapp/var/log/ and testapp/var/mails
- run the script in install/installer.php 
    cd testapp/install && php installer.php
- configure your web server to access to testapp/www with a browser
- you can then run testapp in your browser

To launch tests, go into tests-jelix and run phpunit.
